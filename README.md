# dotfiles
Dotfiles from [Segmented](https://github.com/0xSegmented)

## TMUX
For TMUX we make use of the shortcut: 
- CTRL + D
  - This is because SSH sessions would interfere with it otherwise.

## NEOVIM
I like to use NVIM, I stole dotfiles from some YouTuber - but I can't figure out again who it was. \
So credits to him.
- Theme: Dracula
Recommendation: in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc add: alias vi='nvim' and alias vim='nvim'
